    "## Summary of Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we are attempting to answer the question of whether or not we can predict the geographic region that a U.S. representative comes from using informations about their stock trade. This is a classification problem with our target variable being the greographic region, which contains 4 categories: Midwest, West, Northest, and South. We are grouping the districts into geographic regions to reduce the complexity of the classification task, and we will be using F1 score as our evaluation metric for the classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Baseline Model\n",
    "In our baseline model, we used five features: `'disclosure_year'` (ordinal), `'owner'` (nominal), `'type'` (nominal), `'amount'` (ordinal), and `'cap_gains_over_200_usd'` (nominal).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a measure of the accuracy of our model, the f1-score for the training subset is approximately 0.54 and the score for the testing subset is around 0.53. Both scores are very low, but given that we have 4 categories, it is an okay score to start with. The gap between the two scores is very small, which meant that the model is not overfitting. But since both scores are relatively low, it suggests that we need to be more selective and apply more effective transformations to prediction vairables to improve the model's accuracy. Although the baseline model doesn't show signs of overfitting, the model may improve in accuracy if we increase the complexity. Therefore, we would still need to perform a Grid Search to determine the best combination of values for the hyperparameters of our model. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In our final model, we added 2 features by transforming the columns `'ticker'` and `'asset_description'`. For `'ticker'`, due to the large number of unique tickers in our dataset, we couldn't just apply one-hot encoding to the values. Therefore, we categorized the stocks into 3 ordinal groups by the number of times each ticker is traded within this dataset. The tickers that have been traded for over 10 times are in group 3; the tickers that have been traded between 1 and 10 times are in group 2, and the rest that have only been traded once are in group 1. This may help our classification algroithm in that the number of times a stock is traded may be related to the popularity and size of the company, which may have some relationship to the geographical locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the column `'asset_description'`, we applied a CountVectorizer to transform the descriptions with a bag-of-words approach because we discovered that each entry contained important keywords that describes the business. The addition of this feature improves our model since it will be able to represent the relatedness of stocks given the keyword vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we also performed a grid search to find the best combination of values for the hyperparameters for our Random Forest Classifier. The hyperparameter values we found to perform the best are {'clf__max_depth': 100, 'clf__n_estimators': 500}\n",
    "\n",
    "We picked Random Forest Classifier to use as our model because we have a relatively large dataset, and the complexity of the relationships between the predictor variables and geographic locations suggests that we would need to build a relatively complex model. Since Random Forest is essentially made of multiple decision trees, we decided that it would be a better fit for this classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fairness Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "We performed an accuracy parity test on our classification model on the amount of money traded in relation to the accuracy of the classifications made. We decided to use accuracy as our parity measure due to the nature of our classification problem. Since we have 4 geographic regions to classify the trades into, recall and precision scores would be hard to compute and a bit irrelevant and nonrepresentational as a parity measure of this problem. Therefore, we chose accuracy as our measure to determine whether or not our classification model is fair for trades that were traded for over 15,000 USD and those that were traded for a lesser amount. With a p-value of 0.0, we have found that our model is not fair in regards to the trading amount and that it makes more accurate classifications when the trading amount is large."

    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "With a p-value of 0.0 and a significance level of 0.05, we reject the null and conclude that our classification model is not fair in regards to the amount of money traded using accuracy as oue measure. The result of our permutation test suggests that the trades with trading amount of over 15,000 have higher accuracy of correctly classifying the geographic location that the representative who took that trade reside in. Therefore, with regards to the trading amount, our classification model is not fair.\n",

    "For future improvement of the model, we would be more selective with the training dataset and ensure that for each prediction variable that we are using, there isn't a notable unbalance within the categories. This would reduce the possibility of building a model that compromises fairness. In the meantime, we would look for ways to increase the accuracy of our classification model. Since our final model's training score was very high while our test score was mediocre, this means that there's a high possibility that our model is overfitting on the training data. So in order to improve the model's performance, a further tuning of the hyperparameters is needed. "
